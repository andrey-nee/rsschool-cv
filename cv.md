## __About me__
I used to work in the field of APCS (Automated process control system) and was an engineer-programmer at [Honeywell GES Uzbekistan](https://himavtomatika.uz/).  
Currently, I'm freelancing and specialize in website development.  
I write semantic code using the BEM methodology.  
I strive for high-quality work without the need for constant supervision.  
I'm quick to learn and adapt to new technologies.  
I'm also adept at working in a team.

Currently, my goal is to master JavaScript in order to confidently apply it and find simple and elegant solutions in web development.  
However, I remain open to learning stacks that go beyond front-end development if necessary.
